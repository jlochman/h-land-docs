# Parcels

Heaven Land's Clusters comprise individual Parcels with sizes starting at 25x25 m with 30,000 Parcels in total. Simply put, Parcels are NFTs with some attributes directly encoded into NFT and some attributes derived from a Parcel location in the Heaven Land.

The first class of Parcel's attributes includes size, height (Parcel's Cluster determines maximum height, but the Parcel's height might be smaller), depth (similar to height attribute). The most exclusive Parcel's allow you to drill through the cylinder and build on its outer side.

The remaining attributes can be how far the Parcel is from a Spawning Area, whether the Parcel is at a riverbank or close to a park. Some of these attributes are subjective and depends on the preferences of given Heaven Land citizens.
