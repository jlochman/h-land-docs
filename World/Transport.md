# Transport

Heaven Land is going to be a big city with a need for a well-designed transport grid. The walking, which we expect to be the dominant way of travel, will be accompanied by a teleport to any of 38 Spawning Areas.

The main transport will be by a hyperlink (similar to transport tubes known from Futurama) accompanied by some individual transport vehicles like cars and hovercrafts, whose numbers will be limited to sustain smooth transport of all these vehicles.

Besides transport within the Heaven Land, travel to outer space will be possible.
