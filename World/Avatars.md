# Avatars

Every Heaven Land’s citizen will have its unique name and avatar, further customized by different wearables. Both avatar names and wearables will be tradables.

There will be a limited number of races, each with a different rarity, which a citizen can assign to its avatar (human, martian, zombie). Heaven Land will introduce a breeding mechanism between two avatars to create new races that citizens can trade and apply to their avatars.
