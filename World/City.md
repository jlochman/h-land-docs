# City

Heaven Land is a futuristic city with a design steaming from up-to-date research of self-sustainable cities. Heaven Land is how cities should look, not how they look today.

Heaven land comprises 38 individual Clusters with sizes ranging from 1x1 km to 2x2 km. The centre of every Cluster contains a public space that serves as a Spawning Area - Spawning Areas are the only entrance into Heaven Land. No matter where in Heaven Lend you are, you can always teleport to the Spawning Area. Each public space is unique - gallery, stadium, concert hall, spaceport, harbour and many more.

Clusters are of 4 types depending on the height of a building they can contain. There is only a single Cluster in the centre of Heaven Land, allowing skyscrapers to be built. The further you go from the centre, the more limited you are in the height of the building. No matter where in the cylinder you are, you'll always see the skyscrapers pointing you to the centre of Heaven Land.
